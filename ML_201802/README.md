# MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER / DATA SCIENTIST
## ML Challenge

Here is a small example data set (CSV sample.zip - 40 MB unzipped, 2 MB zipped) containing 66k records/rows and 295 features/columns.
The target variable is the last column (the 296th) with values/classes A,B,C,D,E.
Obviously we challenge you to analyze the data and to build some initial ML model which predicts the classes.

## Steps:

### 1. Make some initial data analysis.
Try to find some structures in the data and how attributes are possibly connected.

### 2. Fit some ML model(s).
Under the models should definitely be some Neural Network and please explain briefly your choices for the models and their pros & cons.

### 3. Show with some X-validation the power of your model and comment the results.
We are of course interested in the overall performance, but much more in the performance per class, especially the under represented ones.

### 4. Present us the results and the steps you have taken.
If possible add also some critical thinking and next possible steps.


## Deliverable & Remarks:
* well commented and easy to follow code
* send us straight .py python files (no ipython notebooks)
* work with classes and functions, show a bit of your programming skills
* PDF (max 3 pages) with brief steps taken and results


## Please use only Python for your solution!

### We don't expect you to build THE solution here.
Our goal here is:
* see how you approach such a problem
* get an idea of your programming skills and ML knowledge
* see how you can summarize and present results
